Gembound is a 2D platformer game. The player navigates a world where the cosmic balance has been shattered. The player collects special gems throughout the time and space levels, with each gem granting a unique ability. The player must master these abilities to overcome obstacles, solve puzzles, and reach previously inaccessible areas containing additional gems. At the end of each level, the player must face a challenging mini-boss that tests their mastery of the collected abilities. The adventure culminates in an epic confrontation with a final boss that requires strategic use of all acquired powers.
